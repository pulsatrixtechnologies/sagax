# Spend cap and sell prices

> 2026-10-14: Settings > Usage in the app shows the signed-in person's own usage only; the spend limit and sell price cards left the app (the organization's admin console manages them). The server routes below are unchanged.

## Sub-features

- Refuse every new turn once the month's cost (reported, plus estimates for
  engines that report tokens but no price) reaches the workspace cap: the
  message routes answer 409 with `code: "spend_cap"`, and a routine, peer hop
  or webhook stops in `startTurn` with the same refusal.
- Notify admins once a month when the month crosses the warning percentage and
  once when it reaches the cap (`notify` frames of kind `spend`, withheld from
  client sessions), remembered across restarts in `<data>/usage/alerts.json`.
- Count a turn the moment it settles, not when the ledger's append lands or a
  cache expires, however long the turn ran: a booked turn counts from memory
  until its row lands, and never twice once it has.
- Book memory upkeep's helper calls to the same ledger and check the cap
  before each capture, organization and contradiction call. Record the helper
  model rather than the bot's conversational model. Deterministic tidy steps
  do not spend tokens and still run at the cap.
- Price turns from the operator's list (`driver/model`, then model, then
  `default`) into a billable column in `/api/usage` and its CSV.
- On with no key: the open-source edition has `budgets` and `billing` on.
  Only an enterprise layer installed from outside this tree can withhold
  them, and the settings are then inert.

## User path

`budgets` and `billing` in `config.json` or through `PUT /api/config`
(`sagax fleet create --cap` seeds the limit). `/api/usage` and its CSV carry a
billable column once prices exist; the composer's send is refused with the
limit message once the cap is reached.

## Driving it

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run --no-file-parallelism server/spend-cap-api.test.ts
```

The test writes a stand-in enterprise layer (the folder shape core loads,
granting `budgets` and `billing`) and launches the `control-omb` fixture with
it through `launchVerificationServer(..., { dir, licenseKey })`, which also
proves a present layer's grant reaches the gates; without a layer both are on
anyway (`server/spend.test.ts` covers that default). It sets a
$0.015 cap and a default price list, sends two turns that the fake engine
books at $0.01 each, and checks the third is refused with 409 `spend_cap`,
that `/api/usage` reports the cap exceeded, warned, and priced, that the CSV
carries `billable_usd`, and that raising the cap lets the next turn through.
It also holds an admin and a chat-only event stream open across the two turns
and checks the admin gets exactly one warning and one cap notice and the
chat-only device gets neither.
It prints the fixture's server log path and removes its temporary homes.
The memory regression also proves that one helper reaching the cap blocks
the next step in that same upkeep pass, and that raising the cap resumes it.

For the same by hand, launch an ordinary fixture (no layer and no key: both
features are on) and use the normal chat-turn commands.

## Unit regressions

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run server/spend.test.ts server/model-prices.test.ts server/prices.ts server/config.test.ts server/usage-ledger.test.ts src/lib/notify.test.ts
```

These cover price precedence and cached-input pricing, month-to-date sums
with the short cache and the just-booked note, the cap enforced with the
open-source default gate, inert behaviour when a layer withholds `budgets` or
no cap is set, the warning threshold, the 409 shape, the saver
persisting `anthropic`, `budgets` and `billing`, the cards rendering only
with their entitlements, the billable column in summaries and CSV, estimated
costs counting against the cap, the list-price table (every entry sourced and
dated, unknown models unpriced, the operator's per-model price winning), and
the once-a-month notices surviving a restart.

## Gotchas

- The cap counts what engines report (real cost on workspace keys, an
  equivalent on personal subscriptions) plus list-price estimates for engines
  that report none. A workspace on subscriptions alone can hit a cap without a
  bill, and a turn on a model the list does not know counts nothing.
- Missing helper token usage stays unpriced unless the provider reports a
  cost; it is not treated as a known zero-dollar call. Already-started calls
  may finish above the cap, which stops subsequent calls rather than reserving
  an unknown future cost.
- Rows written before estimates existed keep `costUsd: null` and stay
  unpriced; only turns settled after the upgrade are estimated, so the month
  of the upgrade can undercount Codex/OpenRouter spend.
- The renderer's cards are proven from fixtures, not driven headlessly here.
